# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

1. Documentation on how to run the code:

The code should run like open the terminal and select the new terminal and run the command of
 "cd client". Then run the command of "npm start".

Take the another terminal of the server and run the command of "cd server", then run the command of "npm start".


2. Logical explanation of all your architectural choices in the project:

My logical explanation is to create the login and register pages and then the board should display of the game if the player wins it should display he is the "Winner". If two persons are not the winners it should display "Draw". When the persons are playing it should dispaly "your move" or "Their move".


3. Assumptions that you have made:

My assumption was 
    I have to see a  video reference of the game and how to write the implement the code in      react.
    How many  pages I have to create.
    Some installations required.

4. Document of the problems you faced while building this app:

It is some what tough to understand the game but I builded the app with my ideas and some references.
I got the errors with that I build the app with my own ideas of creating pages I have build this tic-tac-toe app.
